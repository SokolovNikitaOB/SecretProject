Welcome!

This application is my implementation of the test task in Jar Soft.
It was developed a web application to manage advertising categories and text banners.

/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
Functionality:

The objects can be created, edited and deleted via REST API.
In order to get access to CRUD API, it is necessary to use username and password,
which are equal to admin and nimda respectively.

To get a text banner matches given categories use an URL like this:
http://host:port/bid?cat=cat1&cat=cat2&cat=cat3...
/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Before launching the application in application.properties, you need to select the port and also set your database settings.

Good luck! (to me)
